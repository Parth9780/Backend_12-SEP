# What is List? How will you reverse a list?

1). Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
2). List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
3). List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
4). The list is changeable
    -->meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

Ex.
    thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    print(thislist)
